# Session 1: Introduction to Linux

## Task 1

### 1. Create Your Directory

1. Open a terminal on your Linux system.
2. Create a directory with your first and last names, including spaces. Use the appropriate command to create the directory.
3. Change your current working directory to the newly created directory.

### 2. Make Another Directory and Create Multiple Files

1. Inside your directory, create another directory named "Documents."
2. Change your current working directory to the "Documents" subdirectory.
3. Create three text files named "file1.txt," "file2.txt," and "file3.txt" within the "Documents" directory, **all at once** using a single command.
4. Verify that all three files are created inside the "Documents" directory.

### 3. Hide a File

1. Go back to your main directory (the one with your first and last names) using the appropriate command.
2. Create a hidden file named ".hidden_file" within the main directory.
3. Use the appropriate command to verify that the hidden file is created.

### 4. Write with Nano

1. Use the Nano text editor to write a short message inside the "file1.txt" file you created in Step 2.
2. Save the changes and exit Nano.
3. Display the contents of the "file1.txt" file to ensure your changes are saved.

### 5. Go Back

1. Return to the "Documents" directory using the appropriate command.

### 6. Create a Unique Directory

1. Create a new directory named "-" (a hyphen) within the "Documents" directory.
2. Change your current working directory to this newly created directory.

### 7. Copy Directory

1. Copy the "Documents" directory (and all its contents) to your main directory (the one with your first and last names) using the appropriate command. Give the copied directory a different name (e.g., "My_Documents").
2. Verify that the copy was successful by listing the contents of your main directory.

### 8. Show Hidden Content

1. Display the content of the ".hidden_file" you created in Step 3.

### 9. Move Files

1. Move the "file2.txt" and "file3.txt" files from the "Documents" directory to your main directory (the one with your first and last names) using the appropriate command.
2. Verify that the files are moved successfully.

### 10. Remove Your Directory

1. Go back to your home directory using the appropriate command.
2. Remove your main directory (the one with your first and last names) using the appropriate command.
3. Verify that the main directory is successfully removed.

## Submission Guidelines

**If you did not name your files as instructed, your task will be marked as "did not submit."**

1. Create a new folder named "Session1" in your GitHub repository.
2. Document your steps and commands used in a text file named "session1.txt." and place it inside the "Session1" folder. 
3. Capture a screenshot for each step to show the results of your commands. Save each screenshot with a meaningful name (e.g., S1_step1.png, S1_step2.png) and place them inside the "Session1" folder.

> If you know how to use Markdown, you can use it to format your text file and embed your screenshots.
